Let's take a look at the outline for this course. I don't want to jump right into the projects, though you certainly could if you want. So the first two sections, we will be working in a coding sandbox. In every new video in these sections, we will have a new file to experiment with and learn all about a certain aspect of Tailwind. Next, we will take what we learn in the sandbox environment and use it to create some small projects. These are things that will take 10 - 20 minutes to create and we will do it all in one video per project. Next, we will start to work on larger landing-page websites. This will really put what you learned to the test. There will be 6 different websites. They are all very modern and clean-looking. We partnered with Frontend Mentor for the designs. "
